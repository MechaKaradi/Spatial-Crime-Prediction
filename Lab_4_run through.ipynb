        "\n",
        "One possible representation bias is related to the age and sex of the suspects mentioned in the complaints. The data shows that suspects in the 25-44 age group are the most common, with 1,130,265 complaints, followed by those in the 18-24 age group with 418,316 complaints. However, the data also reveals that 63.3% of suspects are male, compared to only 36.7% who are female. This suggests that complaints against male suspects may be overrepresented in the dataset, which could be a result of police bias or other factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another possible representation bias is related to the race of the suspects mentioned in the complaints. The data shows that Black individuals are the most common suspects in the dataset, with 1,602,791 complaints, followed by those of unknown race with 1,144,932 complaints. White and White Hispanic individuals have significantly fewer complaints, with 463,383 and 725,948 complaints, respectively. This suggests that complaints against Black individuals may be overrepresented in the dataset, which could be a result of racial bias or other factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the age, race, and sex of the suspects in the complaints may be connected to the arrest data, which can be used to test for representation bias. For example, the data shows that suspects in the 25-44 age group are the most common in the arrest dataset as well. However, the arrest data also shows that Black individuals are overrepresented compared to their representation in the general population, which suggests that there may be a representation bias in the complaint dataset as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the NYPD complaint dataset is subject to several possible representation biases related to the age, sex, and race of the suspects mentioned in the complaints. It is important to take these biases into account when interpreting the results and to use additional data sources, such as the arrest data, to test for representation bias. By doing so, we can gain a more accurate understanding of the complaints made against police officers and work towards addressing any unfairness or bias in the criminal justice system."
